                          <p>In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafter by the Elven-smiths, 
                        and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power 
                        so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and though 
                    he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages 
                it fell into the hands of Bilbo Baggins, as tolf in <em>The Hobbit</em>. 
            In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins finds himself faced with an immense 
        task as his elderly cousin Bilbo entrusts the Ring to his care. Frodo must keave his home 
    and ,make a perilous journey across Middle-earth to the Crack of Doom, there 
to destory the Ring and foil the Dark Lord in his evil purpose.</p>  </div>
